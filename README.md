A dataset of used cars and their corresponding characteristics are studied using machine learning regression models to optimize sales tactics and inventory parameters.

PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
What variables have the greatest influence on the price of a used car?
1)	Most data that we have for used cars are sold between 1,000 and 58,0000 USD, and have odometer readings between 1,000 and 400,000 miles
2)	Most used cars that have been purchased are less than 40 years old
3)	Diesel and electric cars tend to sell for the highest prices
4)	California, Florida and Texas have the greatest amount of used car purchases, although state had a very low influence on determining the actual price of the car sold
5)	The most influential factors in the price of a used car are the odometer readings, year of purchase, and car model
6)	The number of cylinders has an influence on price when considered together with year of purchase and odometer readings. This can be understood as a perception that more cylinders increase the wear on a car's engine as antiquity and distance traveled are increased
7)	Some variables have similar influences on the price of a used car, such as fuel + transmission and model + manufacturer

ACTION STEPS:
1)	Focus on cars manufactured within the last 40 years
2)	Lower odometer readings are important for the desirability of a used car
3)	The model of a car can mitigate higher odometer readings to some extent
4)	For cars with more cylinders, it is important to focus on those with lower odometer readings in particular
